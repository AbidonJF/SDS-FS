## Feature Selection using Stochastic Diffusion Search (SDS-FS)

The method introduced in this work uses stochastic diffusion search (SDS) to select the most relevant feature subset for the classification task. In this algorithm, SDS is adapted to find a suitable feature subset. Moreover, support vector machine (SVM) is used as a classifier to evaluate the predictive accuracy of each agent. The proposed method exhibits a statistically significant outperformance when compared with the performance of the classifier without the SDS-powered features selections.
